# WPF Envorimental

## Getting Started
The WPF is a subsgraphic .NET envorimental tool for build up excitement GUIs. Its use XAML for Design that GUIs.

## XAML

- `<StackPanel/>` -> Laid out elements on top of the others
- `<Button/>` -> Creats a button
- `<TextBlock>` -> Similar to `<p></p>` in HTML
- `<Grid/>` Grid is Similar to HTML. When you need to automatically adjust to the size of the window put `<ColumnDefinition/>` 
or `<RowDefinition/>` without with or height.
- To activate or desactivate the wrap on a text, expand the **Text section** ->  **search box** -> type **TextWrapping**
-

## Methods

When you add a method call, apper a light bulb icon at the left side of the window. When you click on the Quick Actions icon, it shows you a context menu with actions. If an action generates a code, it shows you a preview of the code.<br>
`private void SetUpGame()`<br>
`{`<br>
    `throw new NotImplementedException();`<br>
`}`<br><br>

When light bulb appers it can generate code. When it generetes  is shown a `throw new NotImplementedException();`<br>
That is to tell the IDE for "run" a exeption which cuz a generate a message "The method or operation is not implemented." It a like a nicer reminder that you will have work to implement your code.
